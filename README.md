# Weather Dashboard
This is a forecast and current weather webpage. The user is presented with an input that says "Search Your City". When the user clicks the search button, the current weather in the selected city will be displayed on the top row. On the bottom row, 5 cards indicating the upcoming five days will be displayed with the temperature, wind, and humidity for the next five days. If the user searches for a different city, the previous city will be stored in the user's local storage and will be shown as a grey button. If the user clicks the button, the respective city's weather will display.
